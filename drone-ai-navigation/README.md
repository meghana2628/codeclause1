# Drone AI Navigation

## Overview
The Drone AI Navigation project aims to develop an autonomous drone navigation system that utilizes computer vision and reinforcement learning to navigate through environments, avoid obstacles, and reach predefined destinations.

## Features
- **Object Detection**: Implemented using OpenCV to identify and locate obstacles in the drone's path.
- **SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)**: Enables the drone to create a map of its environment while keeping track of its location within that map.
- **Reinforcement Learning**: The drone learns to make decisions based on its environment to optimize its navigation strategy.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd drone-ai-navigation
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the application:
   ```
   python src/main.py
   ```

## Usage
- The drone will start navigating autonomously, utilizing the implemented computer vision and reinforcement learning algorithms.
- Adjust the configuration settings in `src/config/settings.py` to modify parameters for object detection and SLAM.

## Learning Outcomes
- Gain hands-on experience with computer vision techniques using OpenCV.
- Understand the principles of reinforcement learning and its application in real-world scenarios.
- Develop skills in implementing SLAM algorithms for robotics.
